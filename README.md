## 🚀 Key Features

* **Fully Responsive:** A mobile-first design that looks great on all screen sizes, from phones to desktops.
* **Dark/Light Mode:** A theme switcher that saves user preference in `localStorage`.
* **Dynamic Project Loading:** The portfolio section is dynamically loaded from a `projects.json` file using the `fetch` API, making it easy to update.
* **Dual Lightbox System:**
    * An advanced portfolio lightbox with a multi-image gallery slider.
    * A separate lightbox for displaying certificates and achievements.
* **Performant Animations:** Uses the `IntersectionObserver` API to animate elements on scroll, ensuring smooth performance.
* **Vanilla JS:** Built purely with JavaScript (ES6+), with no external libraries like jQuery, for fast loading.
* **Working Contact Form:** Integrated with Formspree for functional form submission.
