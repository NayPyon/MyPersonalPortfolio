    "descriptionModal": "Developed an AI-powered Computer Vision system to assist in early cervical cancer diagnosis by classifying microscopic Pap smear images into Normal, LSIL, and HSIL categories. Leveraging Python and TensorFlow, I implemented a Transfer Learning approach using the MobileNetV2 architecture, enhanced by Data Augmentation and Early Stopping mechanisms to prevent overfitting. This project demonstrates the practical application of deep learning in medical imaging, achieving a validation accuracy of approximately 85% on the SipakMed dataset.",
